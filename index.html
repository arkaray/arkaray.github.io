<p>I have completed my B. Tech from University of Calcutta.
I am currently doing my masters from Computer Science and Automation department of the prestigious Indian Institute of Science (visit <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/">CSA@IISc</a> for more).
I have always taken an interest in the more theoretical side of computer science and have studied, as part of my coursework, 
courses on theory of computation, approximation algorithms, cryptography etc.
I have just started my research on showing lower bounds on packing problems. This work is in collaboration with <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/index.html">Arindam Khan</a>.</p>
<p>Besides my academic endeavours I like to learn and play musical instruments. I know how to play the guitar, flute, and the violin. I can not play them very well. I also enjoy playing table tennis, by which I mean I'll drop everything if challenged for a match. Here are some songs I recorded,</p>
