Hi! I am Arka Ray.
I am currently doing my PhD from Computer Science and Automation department of IISc, Bengaluru (visit [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/ CSA @ IISc]), under [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~anandl/ Anand Louis].
I also did my masters from IISc and did my B. Tech from [https://www.caluniv.ac.in/ University of Calcutta].
I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science.
I currently work on Approximation Algorithms.
I am specially interested in learning more about LP/SDPs.
[https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/index.html Arindam Khan] and I worked on showing inapproximability results for various packing and covering problems as part of my MTech Project.

I have also TA-ed for a bunch of course (as follows).
== Teaching Assistantship
- Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Winter 2020).
- [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/courses/toolkit21/TheoristsToolkit.html Theorist's Toolkit (Winter 2021)].

- Approximation Algorithms (Spring 2024).

I have served as a subreviewer for APPROX 24, [https://algo-conference.org/2023/waoa/ WAOA 23].
