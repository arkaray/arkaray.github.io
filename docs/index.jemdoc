Hi! I am Arka Ray. I am a computer scientist.
Currently, I am doing my PhD from the Computer Science and Automation department of IISc, Bengaluru ([https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/ CSA @ IISc]), advised by [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~anandl/ Anand Louis].
Before this, I did my masters from IISc and my B. Tech from [https://www.caluniv.ac.in/ University of Calcutta].

*Research Interests*: I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science.
# I currently work on Approximation Algorithms.
# I am specially interested in learning more about LP/SDPs.
These days I am trying to learn more about Boolean (valued) functions and high dimensional expanders.
I also want to continue exploring LP and SDP based algorithms, and hardness of approximation (especially "PCP-style" reductions).
#In fact, [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/index.html Arindam Khan] and I worked on showing inapproximability results for various packing and covering problems as part of my MTech Project.

I have served as a subreviewer for FSTTCS 24, APPROX 24, WAOA 23 and as a reviewer for [https://theoryofcomputing.org/index.html Theory of Computation].

I have also TA-ed for a bunch of courses:

and Theorist's Toolkit ([https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/courses/toolkit21/TheoristsToolkit.html Winter 2021]).
