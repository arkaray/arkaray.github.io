Hi! I am Arka Ray.
I am currently doing my PhD from Computer Science and Automation department of IISc, Bengaluru (visit [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/ CSA @ IISc]), under [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~anandl/ Anand Louis].
I also did my masters from IISc and did my B. Tech from [https://www.caluniv.ac.in/ University of Calcutta].
I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science.
I currently work on Approximation Algorithms, Sum of Squares Hierarchy, Simplicial Complexes.
[https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/index.html Arindam Khan] and I worked on showing inapproximability results for various packing and covering problems as part of my MTech Project.
