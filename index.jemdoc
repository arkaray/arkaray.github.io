Hi! I am Arka Ray. 
I did my masters from Computer Science and Automation department of the prestigious Indian Institute of Science (visit [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/ CSA@IISc] for more) and my B. Tech from [https://www.caluniv.ac.in/ University of Calcutta].
I have always taken an interest in the more theoretical side of computer science and have studied, as part of my coursework,
== Courses
- approximation algorithms,
- [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/courses/toolkit20/TheoristsToolkit.html theorist's toolkit],
	-- [docs/sos.pdf LP\/SDP\/Sum of Square Hierarchies] with Rameesh Paul
- [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chandan/courses/complexity20/home.html computational complexity theory],
	-- [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chandan/courses/complexity20/presentations/topic1.pdf Parity not in ACC^0\[q\]] with Nabarun Deka
- [https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/e0_235.html cryptography].

In addition, I was a TA for design and analysis of algorithms (winter 2020).

I currently work on approximation algorithms, and hardness of approximation.
[https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/index.html Arindam Khan] and I worked on showing inapproximability results for various packing and covering problems as part of my MTech Project.
== Manuscripts/Publications
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13362 There is no APTAS for 2-dimensional vector bin packing: Revisited.] CoRR, April 2021.
